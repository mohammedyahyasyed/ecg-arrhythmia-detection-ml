# ecg-arrhythmia-detection-ml
This project implements an automated ECG heartbeat classification system using machine learning to detect cardiac arrhythmias from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset is used to train and evaluate supervised learning models, with a focus on comparing the performance of a linear classifier (Logistic Regression)
